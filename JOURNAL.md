## Day 1 
I created the initial structure for the website. I set up the main files: index.html, styles.css and script.js. I also added the basic navbar layout and the about, previous work, projects and contact. I chose a sage green aesthetic for my project.

## Day 2
I worked on the general layout and structure of the page. I built the About section using HTML and styled it with Flexbox. I added an image placeholder, created a text container, and applied my theme colors. I learned how important spacing, padding and layout consistency are for a clean design. 

## Day 3
I integrated Bootstrap into the project. I did this to showcase my projects using carousel

## Day 4
I focused on writing the JS file. I programmed the contact form so that it validates the name, email and message fields.
